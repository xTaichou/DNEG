This is a significant project as it will test your knowledge on the various concepts of Python. You need to build an app
 that anyone uses to explore the files in their system. You can also add features like searching and copy-paste.
 Tkinter is a commendable choice for this project as it makes the development of GUI applications fast and easy.

To create the Python File Explorer using Tkinter, you have to import the filedialog module from Tkinter. This module is
designed for opening files and directories and saving them.
