# Python work


I am in the process of creating a few mini projects so I can keep my python skills current while I work on other technologies. These programs are really basic and the list fo work will continue to grow as I practice more advanced topics.

Feel free to use them as you wish (if you do).

The projects so far are as follows:
Calculator
Password generator
Alarm clock

For further details on each see each corresponding .py file
